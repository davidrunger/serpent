# Serpent To-Do's

* Instructions
* Leaderboard (first to 10 wins)
* Resolve ties as ties
* Draw frame just before collision but don't have snakes cross onto each other
* Allow multi-player over the Internet
* Single-player option
* Spinner to adjust intelligence of AI (probably not; would complicate leaderboard)
* Have AI consider whether it's going to run into a snake when moving
* Shepherd tour?
* favicon
* remove bug caused when changing speed during countdown (or something like that)
* rewrite in React
* requestAnimationFrame?

# Done

* Fix eyes of snake2
* End game when snakes collide with each other
* Logo
* End game when a player reaches a certain score (changeable through spinner?)
* Local storage to remember preferences
* Use apple graphic instead of simple red circle
* Better styling
* Build AI
